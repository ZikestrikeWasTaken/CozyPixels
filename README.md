## ⚠️ About This Collection

> [!NOTE]
> **This is my personal wallpaper collection** that I've been using and curating over the past year. Since many viewers/subscribers asked me to share these, I'm making them available here.

**Important:** Most wallpapers were saved from **various social media platforms** (X, Reddit, GitHub, etc.) without tracking sources. If you recognize your work:
 1. **Contact me** with proof
 2. I'll **add proper credit** immediately
 3. Or request removal if preferred

**To the amazing artists out there:** If you see your artwork here without credit, please know it's because I genuinely loved and used your work - not because I'm claiming it as mine. A huge thank you for creating such beautiful wallpapers! 🙏
